### Introduction

This course primarily centers around learning OS design internals and
conducting research in operating systems, with the key component structured as
a final project. A successful project should entail a novel contribution,
avoiding mere replication of existing systems or ideas. It's permissible if
your project aligns with your graduate research, as long as it intersects with
the course themes.

Collaboration is essential; projects should be undertaken in pairs. Assessment
of projects will encompass a final presentation, such as a video demonstration,
along with a comprehensive project write-up.


### Milestones

**(More detail coming.)**

- Project Proposal (TBD): Send us a short email describing your project idea,
  how you plan to evaluate it, and your teammate (if applicable).

- Midterm Project Report (TBD): Send us a draft of your project report,
  focusing on the motivation and design of your system, sans an evaluation.

- Final Project Report and demo (TBD): Send us a complete version of your write
  up, including improvements upon the draft plus an evaluation of your system.

### Project Ideas

You're welcome to choose your own project ideas. Here are some suggestions. We
will continue to update this list as the course progresses.
