### Introduction

This course primarily centers around learning OS design internals and
conducting research in operating systems, with the key component structured as
a final project. A successful project should entail a novel contribution,
avoiding mere replication of existing systems or ideas. It's permissible if
your project aligns with your graduate research, as long as it intersects with
the course themes.

Collaboration is essential; projects should be undertaken in pairs. Assessment
of projects will encompass a final presentation, such as a video demonstration,
along with a comprehensive project write-up.

### Milestones

- Project Proposal (9/15 11:59pm): Share a brief proposal describing your
  project idea, how you plan to evaluate it, and your teammate.

- Midterm Project Report (11/3 11:59pm): Share your project report, focusing on
  the design and implementation of your system, an initial evaluation, etc.

- Final Project Report and demo (TBD): Send us a complete version of your write
  up, including improvements upon the draft plus an evaluation of your system.


### Proposal (DDL: 9/15 11:59pm)

The proposal should be sent to instructor via Email with the subject line
"CS5204: Project Proposal." by 11:59pm on 9/15.

In your proposal, please provide concise explanations for the following:

1. The overarching question you intend to address.
2. The context, background, and significance of the problem.
3. A high-level overview of your proposed solutions to tackle the issue.
4. A timeline outlining key milestones for project completion.
5. An evaluation plan detailing metrics, approaches, and experiments for
   validating your design.
6. Your anticipated outcomes and expected results.

Please utilize the LaTeX template available at this
[link](https://github.com/huaicheng/cs6204proj) for your proposal, midterm
report, and final report. **The proposal should be no more than 2 pages.**

If your project has any connection to (Operating) Systems, that's perfectly
fine with me. This way, you won't have to invest extra time in starting a
completely new project, which might not be very realistic to accomplish. Your
system/OS hacking skills will naturally improve through the ongoing labs
throughout the semesters, and these labs will serve as a bridge between the
theoretical knowledge imparted in lectures.

### Project Midterm Report (DDL: 11/3 11:59pm)

Please submit your report via Email addressed to huaicheng@cs.vt.edu, with a
title "CS5204: Midterm Report", attach your pdf report, by **11:59pm on 11/3**.

Please use the latex template you used for the proposal.

1. Problem statement: what is the *specific* question you're try to tackle
2. Recap of your high-level steps you plan to approach your solution and clear
   statement of where you're NOW in terms of the proposed timeline/milestone
3. Detailed write-up about your achieve so far, including but not limited to:
  - The functionalities/design you have implemented or getting close to be done
    with
  - The initial results if any (figures, tables, etc.)
  - What's the experimental setup? workloads? results?
4. Initial conclusions


### Project Final Report (DDL: 12/10 11:59pm)

You need to submit (1). a 6-page final report for your course project, and (2).
link to a 10min recorded video.

Please submit your report via Email addressed to huaicheng@cs.vt.edu, with a
title "CS5204: Final Report", attach your pdf report and video presentation
link, by **11:59pm on 12/10**.

Please use our latex template you used for the proposal.

Please write your final paper in the format of research papers that you present
in class.


### Project Ideas

You're welcome to choose your own project ideas. If not, please schedule a
meeting with the instructor to figure out one.
