### Introduction

The main focus of this class is in research in operating systems, which will be
structured as a class final project. A good project will make a new
contribution, rather than implementing an existing system or idea. It can be
related to your graduate research, as long as it overlaps with the themes in
the course. Collaboration is required: each project can be done in groups of
two or individually (only for exception cases). Projects will be evaluated
based on a final presentation (e.g., video demo) and a project write up.

### Milestones

**(More detail coming.)**

- Project Proposal (TBD): Send us a short email describing your project idea,
  how you plan to evaluate it, and your teammate (if applicable).

- Midterm Project Report (TBD): Send us a draft of your project report,
  focusing on the motivation and design of your system, sans an evaluation.

- Final Project Report and demo (TBD): Send us a complete version of your write
  up, including improvements upon the draft plus an evaluation of your system.

### Project Ideas

You're welcome to choose your own project ideas. Here are some suggestions. We
will continue to update this list as the course progresses.
